# Austin House Prices

## Summary  
The User will be asked to input housing features and click submit, which will send all the data through a machine learning algorithm to get the resulting housing price. The dashboard also includes a tab to display a map where houses can be selected to look at their features and prices. Another tab includes stats where graphs and plots can be viewed.
