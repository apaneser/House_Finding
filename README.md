# House_Finding

## Summary
the user will be asked to input housing features such as price, lot size, bedroom count, etc and a map will be displayed that fits within those inputs. there will also be an option to check places that have been in that range 5 years ago and also to use machine learning to find houses that may or may not fit that criteria in the future. the area covered depends on the dataset chosen.

* +has a large amount of data that has prices for 14 years
* +may be great for maching learning
* -is not current



## alternative project using similar concept
the user inputs their data such as age, income, etc and the machine learning algorithm finds what kind of home would fit them
possiblke dataset to use on this project: https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices
